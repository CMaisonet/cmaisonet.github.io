This is just a simple site from a course I am taking via Udemy. 
At first my js was not working here a simple change to the http: into https: made all the difference.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- jQuery Cycle2 (for image slideshow)

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Semantic HTML structure (`header`, `nav`, `section`, `aside`, `footer`)
- Custom CSS styling with floats and layout control
- Responsive design principles
- Setting up a GitHub Pages deployment
- Organizing project files and writing clean, readable code

## 📌 Notes
- This project was built as part of my front-end learning journey. I wrote every line of code myself while watching a course tutorial. 
- It's not a clone — it's a **customized version** based on the instructor's guidance.
- I plan to use this as one of several projects in my developer portfolio.

## ✅ Next Steps
- Build additional projects using JavaScript (vanilla and/or React)
- Create a personal portfolio site
- Continue developing interactive apps to showcase dynamic functionality
